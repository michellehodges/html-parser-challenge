Writing the server-side
=======================

I chose to write in Node because it seems like the simpler approach to the problem; also, I haven't coded in Node for about 
4 weeks so I thought this would be a great refresher to my skillset. 

Throughout the process, I used a few new libraries that I have never used before: MySQL, Cheerio, Promise-MySQL, and Express-Fileupload. 

I got stuck in a rut for a little while trying to implement promises with MySQL on Node. First of all, I didn't think I needed promises, until I realized that I was stuck in Asynchronous hell. Second of all, it took me a while to get the code formatting right for my promise to run. However, once I figured that out everything went smoothly from there, and implementing promises to the rest of my functionality was all gravy. 

I think one of the process that took a while in the beginning for me was setting up; It is weird to move back and forth languages sometimes. 
Its definitely really nice to be back in JavaScript land from focusing on Java the past few weeks.

I really wanted to do the final bonus problem, which is to parse multiple sections of the HTML content at the same time for performance. However, I'm currently on my flight to Iceland and I think my husband would like for me to enjoy this vacation :) 

I did implement a few things that was not required, such as a log in page, sessions, and the upload capability. It seemed natural for me to add this into the app, so thought I'd throw it in there.
