The way the data gets processed
===============================

Everything under ./data will get scored if the "Score Now!" button gets hit once. The data that has been scored will be moved to the "scored" folder so that it does not get reprocessed again. 

That said, you can upload HTML files from wherever from your local drive. It will get moved to ./data, renamed to the format "sessionowner_YYYY_MM_DD.html", scored, then moved to the ./data/scored folder.
