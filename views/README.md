HTML Rendering
==============

Not much to be said here... 

I used Mustache to render HTML to the DOM. Other than Mustache I've used Thymeleaf with Java on Spring. Mustache is very simple and enjoyable to use. 

Originally I had way more pages (error page, sign up page, redirect) but realized that I only had little time to edit them, so I simplified to only render 2 pages.
