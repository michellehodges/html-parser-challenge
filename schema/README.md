Switching over to MySQL from Postgres
=====================================

So far, in terms of relational databases, I only had experience with Postgres so I had to learn how to write in MySQL.
Turns out, writing MySQL is much simpler than Postgres! Definitely had a great experience with this one, I think I might even
prefer it now.

The biggest issue I saw with MySQL was getting the queries to work with Node. However, once I spent significant amount of time trying to
figure that out, everything was all gravy.
